            There is no parking at the Hillingdon Civic Centre. However, The
            Chimes multi-storey car park is only a minute's walk away, and costs
            Â£2.70 for parking on Sundays. The postcode for this is UB8 1TP.

            Unfortunately there isn't a lot of parking space at The Woodman, and
            we recommend that you don't try to park in their car park. There is
            a small amount of free parking down the nearby side roads.

            Alternatively, there is a car park near Eastcote station, and the
            282 bus will take you to directly outside The Woodman.

            If you are arriving by public transport, Eastcote station is on the
            Uxbridge branch of the Metropolitan line, followed by the 282 bus to
            take you to The Woodman.

            The Woodman's postcode is HA5 2PR, and bear in mind that it will be
            a Sunday, so some public transport may end early.
